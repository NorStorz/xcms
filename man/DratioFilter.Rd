\usage{
DratioFilter(
  threshold = 0.5,
  qcIndex = integer(),
  studyIndex = integer(),
  na.rm = TRUE,
  mad = FALSE
)

\S4method{filterFeatures}{XcmsResult,DratioFilter}(object, filter)

\S4method{filterFeatures}{SummarizedExperiment,DratioFilter}(object, filter, assay = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{threshold}{`numeric` value representing the threshold. Features with a
coefficient of variation higher than this will be removed from the entire
dataset.}

\item{qcIndex}{`integer` (or `logical`) Vector corresponding to the indexes of
QC samples.}

\item{studyIndex}{`integer` (or `logical`) Vector corresponding of the
indexes of study samples.}

\item{na.rm}{`logical` Indicates whether missing values (`NA`) should be
removed prior to the calculations.}

\item{mad}{`logical` Indicates whether the *Median Absolute Deviation*
(MAD) should be used instead of the standard deviation. This is suggested
for non-gaussian distributed data.}

\item{object}{\code{XcmsExperiment} or \code{SummarizedExperiment}. For an
\code{XcmsExperiment} object, the \code{featureValues(object)} will be evaluated, and
for \code{Summarizedesxperiment} the \code{assay(object, assay)}. The object will be
filtered.}

\item{filter}{The parameter object selecting and configuring the type of
filtering. It can be one of the following classes: \code{\link{RsdFilter}},
\code{\link{DratioFilter}}, \code{\link{PercentMissingFilter}} or \code{\link{BlankFlag}}.}

\item{assay}{For filtering of \code{SummarizedExperiment} objects only. Indicates
which assay the filtering will be based on. Note that the features for the
entire object will be removed, but the computations are performed on a single
assay. Default is 1, which mean the first assay of the \code{object} will
be evaluated.}
}
\value{
For `DratioFilter`: a `DratioFilter` class. `filterFeatures` return
the input object minus the features that did not met the user input threshold
}
\description{
The `DratioFilter` class and method enable users to filter features from an
`XcmsExperiment` or `SummarizedExperiment` object based on the D-ratio or
*dispersion ratio*. This is defined as the standard deviation for QC
samples divided by the standard deviation for biological test samples, for
each feature of the object.

This `filter` is part of the possible dispatch of the
generic function `filterFeatures`.  Features *above* the user-input
threshold will be removed from the entire dataset.
