\title{Grouping of LC-MS features}
\usage{
\S4method{featureGroups}{XCMSnExp}(object)

\S4method{featureGroups}{XCMSnExp}(object) <- value
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an [XCMSnExp()] object.}

\item{value}{for `featureGroups<-`: replacement for the feature groups in
`object`. Has to be of length 1 or length equal to the number of features
in `object`.}
}
\description{
After correspondence analysis ([xcms::groupChromPeaks()]) the identified
LC-MS features can be further grouped based on different criteria into
*feature groups* which contain ideally features representing
ions (adducts, isotopes) of the same compound/metabolite.

See [MsFeatures::groupFeatures()] for an overview on the general feature
grouping concept as well as details on the individual settings and
parameters.

The available options for `groupFeatures` on `xcms` preprocessing results
(i.e. on `XCMSnExp` objects after correspondence analysis with
[groupChromPeaks()]) are:

- Grouping by similar retention times: [groupFeatures-similar-rtime()].

- Grouping by similar feature values across samples:
  [AbundanceSimilarityParam()].

- Grouping by similar peak shape of extracted ion chromatograms:
  [EicCorrelationParam()].

An ideal workflow grouping features should sequentially perform the above
methods (in the listed order).

Feature groups can be accessed with the `featureGroups` function.
