\title{Filter features based on the percentage of missing data}
\usage{
PercentMissingFilter(threshold = 30, f = character())

\S4method{filterFeatures}{XcmsResult,PercentMissingFilter}(object, filter)

\S4method{filterFeatures}{SummarizedExperiment,PercentMissingFilter}(object, filter, assay = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{threshold}{`numeric`  percent of accepted missing data for one feature.
If a feature has a percentage of missing data *above* the threshold, it
will be removed.}

\item{f}{`vector` of the same length as the `object`, specifying the sample
type for each sample in the dataset. The percentage of missing values will
be computed for each of the sample types.}

\item{object}{\code{XcmsExperiment} or \code{SummarizedExperiment}. For an
\code{XcmsExperiment} object, the \code{featureValues(object)} will be evaluated, and
for \code{Summarizedesxperiment} the \code{assay(object, assay)}. The object will be
filtered.}

\item{filter}{The parameter object selecting and configuring the type of
filtering. It can be one of the following classes: \code{\link{RsdFilter}},
\code{\link{DratioFilter}}, \code{\link{PercentMissingFilter}} or \code{\link{BlankFlag}}.}

\item{assay}{For filtering of \code{SummarizedExperiment} objects only. Indicates
which assay the filtering will be based on. Note that the features for the
entire object will be removed, but the computations are performed on a single
assay. Default is 1, which mean the first assay of the \code{object} will
be evaluated.}
}
\value{
For `PercentMissingFilter`: a `PercentMissingFilter` class.
`filterFeatures` return the input object minus the features that did not met
the user input threshold
}
\description{
The `PercentMissingFilter` class and method enable users to filter features
from an `XcmsExperiment` or `SummarizedExperiment` object based on the
percentage of missing values for each features and filters them according to
a provided threshold.

This `filter` is part of the possible dispatch of the generic function
`filterFeatures`. The features *above* the user input threshold will be
removed by calling the `filterFeatures` function.
}
\examples{

## load test dataset
xmse_full <- loadXcmsData("xmse")

## prepare input for filter
f <- sampleData(xmse_full)$sample_type

## Create filter object
filter <- PercentMissingFilter(f = f)

## filter the experiment
xmse_filtered <- filterFeatures(object = xmse_full, filter = filter)
