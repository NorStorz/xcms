\usage{
plotFeatureGroups(
  x,
  xlim = numeric(),
  ylim = numeric(),
  xlab = "retention time",
  ylab = "m/z",
  pch = 4,
  col = "#00000060",
  type = "o",
  main = "Feature groups",
  featureGroups = character()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{[XCMSnExp()] object with grouped features (i.e. after calling
[groupFeatures()].}

\item{xlim}{`numeric(2)` with the lower and upper limit for the x-axis.}

\item{ylim}{`numeric(2)` with the lower and upper limit for the y-axis.}

\item{xlab}{`character(1)` with the label for the x-axis.}

\item{ylab}{`character(1)` with the label for the y-axis.}

\item{pch}{the plotting character. Defaults to `pch = 4` i.e. plotting
features as crosses. See [par()] for more information.}

\item{col}{color to be used to draw the features. At present only a single
color is supported.}

\item{type}{plotting type (see [par()]). Defaults to `type = "o"` which
draws each feature as a point and connecting the features of the same
feature group with a line.}

\item{main}{`character(1)` with the title of the plot.}

\item{featureGroups}{optional `character` of feature group IDs to draw only
specified feature group(s). If not provided, all feature groups are
drawn.}
}
\description{
`plotFeatureGroups` visualizes defined feature groups in the m/z by
retention time space. Features are indicated by points with features from
the same feature group being connected by a line. See [featureGroups()]
for details on and options for feature grouping.
