\arguments{
\item{x}{A [XcmsExperiment()] or [XCMSnExp()] object.}

\item{file}{For `plotChromPeaks`: `integer(1)` specifying the
index of the file within `x` for which the plot should be created.
Defaults to `file = 1`.}

\item{xlim}{`numeric(2)` specifying the x-axis limits (retention time
dimension). Defaults to `xlim = NULL` in which case the full retention
time range of the file is used.}

\item{ylim}{For `plotChromPeaks`: `numeric(2)` specifying the
y-axis limits (m/z dimension). Defaults to `ylim = NULL` in which
case the full m/z range of the file is used.}

\item{add}{For `plotChromPeaks`: `logical(1)` whether the plot
should be added to an existing plot or if a new plot should be created.}

\item{border}{For `plotChromPeaks`: the color for the rectangles'
border.}

\item{col}{For `plotChromPeaks`: the color to be used to fill the
rectangles.}

\item{xlab}{`character(1)` defining the x-axis label.}

\item{ylab}{For `plotChromPeaks`: `character(1)` defining the
y-axis label.}

\item{main}{`character(1)` defining the plot title. By default (i.e.
`main = NULL`) the name of the file will be used as title.}

\item{msLevel}{`integer(1)` defining the MS level from which the peaks
should be visualized.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the `plot` (for
`plotChromPeaks`) and `image` (for
`plotChromPeakImage`) functions. Ignored for `add = TRUE`.}

\item{binSize}{For `plotChromPeakImage`: `numeric(1)` defining the
size of the bins along the x-axis (retention time). Defaults to
`binSize = 30`, peaks within each 30 seconds will thus counted and
plotted.}

\item{log}{For `plotChromPeakImage`: `logical(1)` whether the peak
counts should be log2 transformed before plotting.}

\item{yaxt}{For `plotChromPeakImage`: `character(1)` defining
whether y-axis labels should be added. To disable the y-axis use
`yaxt = "n"`. For any other value of `yaxt` the axis will be
drawn. See [par()] help page for more details.}

\description{
`plotChromPeaks` plots the identified chromatographic
peaks from one file into the plane spanned by the retention time (x-axis)
and m/z (y-axis) dimension. Each chromatographic peak is plotted as a
rectangle representing its width in RT and m/z dimension.

`plotChromPeakImage` plots the number of detected peaks for
each sample along the retention time axis as an *image* plot, i.e.
with the number of peaks detected in each bin along the retention time
represented with the color of the respective cell.
}
\details{
The width and line type of the rectangles indicating the detected
chromatographic peaks for the `plotChromPeaks` function can be
specified using the `par` function, i.e. with `par(lwd = 3)`
and `par(lty = 2)`, respectively.
}
\examples{

## Load a test data set with detected peaks
data(faahko_sub)
## Update the path to the files for the local system
dirname(faahko_sub) <- system.file("cdf/KO", package = "faahKO")

## plotChromPeakImage: plot an image for the identified peaks per file
plotChromPeakImage(faahko_sub)

## Show all detected chromatographic peaks from the first file
plotChromPeaks(faahko_sub)

## Plot all detected peaks from the second file and restrict the plot to a
## mz-rt slice
plotChromPeaks(faahko_sub, file = 2, xlim = c(3500, 3600), ylim = c(400, 600))
