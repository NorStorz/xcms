\item{object}{An object of class `XcmsExperiment` with defined ChromPeaks.}

\item{param}{An object of class `LamaParama` that will later be used for
adjustment using the [adjustRtime()] function.}

\item{`LamaParama`}{same object that will be passed to the `adjustRtime()`
function. To run this function the `matchLamasChromPeaks()` need to be run
on this first.}

\item{assay}{`numeric(1)`, assay that should be plotted.}
}
\value{
A `LamaParama` object with new slot rtMap composed of a list of
matrices representing the 1:1 matches between Lamas (ref) and ChromPeaks
(obs).

\description{
This function quickly matches each file's ChromPeaks to Lamas, allowing the
user to evaluate the matches for each file.

Generates a summary of the LamaParama method. Composed of coverage % of the
chrompeaks match over the total chrompeaks of the object. as well as a
summary of the model that will be applied to the file to adjust the
retention times

the `plot()` function for `LamaParama` object allows to plot the obs
chromatographic peaks versus the reference lamas as well as the fitting
line for the chosen model type. The user can decide what file to inspect by
specifying the assay number with the parameter `assay`
}
\note{
If there are no matches, the file retention will not be adjusted when
calling [adjustRtime()] with the same `LamaParama` and `XcmsExperiment`
object.
