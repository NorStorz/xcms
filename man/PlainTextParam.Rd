\usage{
PlainTextParam(path = tempdir())

\S4method{storeResults}{MsExperiment,PlainTextParam}(object, param)

\S4method{storeResults}{XcmsExperiment,PlainTextParam}(object, param)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{for `PlainTextParam` `character(1)`, defining where the files are
going to be stored. The default will be `tempdir()`.}

\item{object}{\code{MsExperiment} or \code{XcmsExperiment} The data object that needs
to be saved.}

\item{param}{The parameter object selecting and configuring the format for
saving. It can be one of the following classes: \code{\link{RDataParam}},
\code{\link{PlainTextParam}}, or \code{MzTabMParam}.}
}
\value{
for `PlainTextParam`: a `PlainTextParam` class. `storeResults` does
not return anything but saves the object to collections of different plain
text files to a folder.
}
\description{
The `PlainTextParam` class and method enable users to save `MsExperiment` or
`XcmsExperiment` objects as collections of plain text files in a specified
folder.

For an `MsExperiment` object, the exported files include:

- The [`sampleData()`] stored as a text file named "sample_data.txt".

- The [`fileNames()`] of the *Spectra* object stored in a tabular format in a
text file named "spectra_files.txt". This method only works if the `Spectra`
object has an backend `MsBackendMzR`. If it does not, not spectra data will
be exported.

- Processing queue of the `Spectra` object, ensuring that any spectra data
modifications are retained. It is stored in a `json` file named
"spectra_processing_queue.json".

For an `XcmsExperiment` object, the exported files are the same as those
for an `MsExperiment` object, with the addition of the following:

- The [`processHistory()`] information of the object, stored in a `json` file
named "process_history.json".

- The chromatographic peak information obtained with [`chromPeaks()`] and
[`chromPeaksData()`], stored in tabular format in the text files
"chrom_peaks.txt" and "chrom_peaks_data.txt" respectively.

- The retention time information obtained with [`adjustedRtime()`] stored
in the text file named "rtime_adjusted.txt".

- The [`featureDefinitions()`] stored in a text file named
"feature_definitions.txt". Additionally, a second file named
"feature_peak_index.txt" is generated to connect the features' definitions
with their names.

This `param` class and method are part of the possible dispatch of the
generic function `storeResults`.

\examples{
## Load test data set of class `MsExperiment`
library(MsExperiment)
fls <- dir(system.file("sciex", package = "msdata"), full.names = TRUE)
pd <- data.frame(file = basename(fls),
                 sample = c("POOL_1", "POOL_2"),
                 injection_index = c(1, 19),
                group = "POOL")
rownames(pd) <- c("1", "2")
mse <- readMsExperiment(fls, sampleData = pd)

## Define param
param <- PlainTextParam(path = "/test/path/")

## Save as a collection of plain text files
storeResults(object = mse, param = param)

## Load a test data set with detected peaks, of class `XcmsExperiment`
faahko_sub <- loadXcmsData("faahko_sub2")

## Define param
param <- PlainTextParam(path = "/test/path/")

## Save as a collection of plain text files
storeResults(object = faahko_sub, param = param)
