\title{Filter features based on their coefficient of variation}
\usage{
RsdFilter(threshold = 0.3, qcIndex = integer(), na.rm = TRUE, mad = FALSE)

\S4method{filterFeatures}{XcmsResult,RsdFilter}(object, filter)

\S4method{filterFeatures}{SummarizedExperiment,RsdFilter}(object, filter, assay = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{threshold}{`numeric` value representing the threshold. Features with a
coefficient of variation higher than this will be removed from the entire
dataset.}

\item{qcIndex}{`integer` (or logical) vector corresponding to the indexes of
QC samples.}

\item{na.rm}{`logical` indicates whether missing values (`NA`) should be
removed prior to the calculations.}

\item{mad}{`logical` indicates whether the *Median Absolute Deviation*
(MAD) should be used instead of the standard deviation. This is suggested
for non-gaussian distributed data.}

\item{object}{\code{XcmsExperiment} or \code{SummarizedExperiment}. For an
\code{XcmsExperiment} object, the \code{featureValues(object)} will be evaluated, and
for \code{Summarizedesxperiment} the \code{assay(object, assay)}. The object will be
filtered.}

\item{filter}{The parameter object selecting and configuring the type of
filtering. It can be one of the following classes: \code{\link{RsdFilter}},
\code{\link{DratioFilter}}, \code{\link{PercentMissingFilter}} or \code{\link{BlankFlag}}.}

\item{assay}{For filtering of \code{SummarizedExperiment} objects only. Indicates
which assay the filtering will be based on. Note that the features for the
entire object will be removed, but the computations are performed on a single
assay. Default is 1, which mean the first assay of the \code{object} will
be evaluated.}
}
\value{
For `RsdFilter`: a `RsdFilter` class. `filterFeatures` return the
input object minus the features that did not met the user input threshold.
}
\description{
The `RsdFilter` class and methods enable users to filter features from an
`XcmsExperiment` or `SummarizedExperiment` object based on their coefficent
of variation for a specified threshold.

This `filter` is part of the possible dispatch of the generic function
`filterFeatures`. Features *above* the user-input threshold will be
removed from the entire dataset.
