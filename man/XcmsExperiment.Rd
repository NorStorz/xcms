\title{Next Generation \code{xcms} Result Object}
\description{
The \code{XcmsExperiment} is a data container for \code{xcms} preprocessing results
(i.e. results from chromatographic peak detection, alignment and
correspondence analysis).

It provides the same functionality than the \link{XCMSnExp} object, but uses the
more advanced and modern MS infrastructure provided by the \code{MsExperiment}
and \code{Spectra} Bioconductor packages. With this comes a higher flexibility on
how and where to store the data.
