subset.}

\item{j}{For \code{[}: not supported.}

\item{drop}{For \code{[}: ignored.}

function supports it).}

\item{keepAdjustedRtime}{\code{logical(1)}: whether adjusted retention times (if
present) should be retained.}

\item{value}{For \code{featureValues}: \code{character(1)} defining which value should
be reported for each feature in each sample. Can be any column of the
\code{chromPeaks} matrix or \code{"index"} if simply the index of the assigned
peak should be returned. Defaults to \code{value = "into"} thus the
integrated peak area is reported.}

\item{mz}{For \code{chromPeaks} and \code{featureDefinitions}: \code{numeric(2)} optionally
defining the m/z range for which chromatographic peaks or feature
definitions should be returned. The full m/z range is used by default.}

\item{ppm}{For \code{chromPeaks} and \code{featureDefinitions}: optional \code{numeric(1)}
specifying the ppm by which the m/z range (defined by \code{mz} should be
extended. For a value of \code{ppm = 10}, all peaks within \code{mz[1] - ppm / 1e6}

specifying which chromatographic peaks to keep. If \code{logical} the
length of \code{keep} needs to match the number of rows of \code{chromPeaks}.
Alternatively, \code{keep} allows to specify the \code{index} (row) of peaks
to keep or their ID (i.e. row name in \code{chromPeaks}).}

\item{method}{For \code{featureValues}: \code{character(1)} specifying the method to
resolve multi-peak mappings within the same sample (correspondence
analysis can assign more than one chromatographic peak within a sample
to the same feature, e.g. if they are close in retention time). Options:
\code{method = "medret"}: report the value for the chromatographic peak
closest to the feature's median retention time.
\code{method = "maxint"}: report the value for the chromatographic peak
with the largest signal (parameter \code{intensity} allows to select the
column in \code{chromPeaks} that should be used for \emph{signal}).
\code{method = "sum"}: sum the value for all chromatographic peaks in a
sample assigned to the same feature. The default is \code{method = "medret"}.
For \code{filterChromPeaks}: currently only \code{method = "keep"} is supported.}

for the respective features in the samples in which no peak was
detected.}

Allows to define the value that should be reported for a missing peak
intensity. Defaults to \code{missing = NA_real_}.}

\description{
The \code{XcmsExperiment} is a data container for \code{xcms} preprocessing results
(i.e. results from chromatographic peak detection, alignment and
correspondence analysis).

It provides the same functionality than the \link{XCMSnExp} object, but uses the
more advanced and modern MS infrastructure provided by the \code{MsExperiment}
and \code{Spectra} Bioconductor packages. With this comes a higher flexibility on
how and where to store the data.

Documentation of the various functions for \code{XcmsExperiment} objects are
grouped by topic and provided in the sections below.

The default \code{xcms} workflow is to perform
\itemize{
\item chromatographic peak detection using \code{\link[=findChromPeaks]{findChromPeaks()}}
\item optionally refine identified chromatographic peaks using
\code{\link[=refineChromPeaks]{refineChromPeaks()}}
\item perform an alignment (retention time adjustment) using \code{\link[=adjustRtime]{adjustRtime()}}.
Depending on the method used this requires to run a correspondence
analysis first
\item perform a correspondence analysis using the \code{\link[=groupChromPeaks]{groupChromPeaks()}} function
to group chromatographic peaks across samples to define the LC-MS
features.
\item optionally perform a gap-filling to \emph{rescue} signal in samples in which
no chromatographic peak was identified and hence a missing value would
be reported. This can be performed using the \code{\link[=fillChromPeaks]{fillChromPeaks()}} function.
}
}
\section{Subsetting and filtering}{

\itemize{
\item \code{[}: subset an \code{XcmsExperiment} by \strong{sample} (parameter \code{i}). Subsetting
will by default drop correspondence results (as subsetting by samples will
obviously affect the feature definition) and alignment results (adjusted
retention times) while identified chromatographic peaks (for the selected
samples) will be retained. Which preprocessing results should be
kept or dropped can also be configured with optional parameters
\code{keepChromPeaks} (by default \code{TRUE}), \code{keepAdjustedRtime} (by default
\code{FALSE}) and \code{keepFeatures} (by default \code{FALSE}).
\item \code{filterChromPeaks}: filter chromatographic peaks of an \code{XcmsExperiment}
keeping only those specified with parameter \code{keep}. Returns the
\code{XcmsExperiment} with the filtered data. Chromatographic peaks to
retain can be specified either by providing their index in the
\code{chromPeaks} matrix, their ID (rowname in \code{chromPeaks}) or with a
\code{logical} vector with the same length than number of rows of
\code{chromPeaks}. Assignment of chromatographic peaks are updated to
eventually present feature definitions after filtering.
\item \code{filterFile}: filter an \code{XcmsExperiment} (or \code{MsExperiment}) by \emph{file}
(sample). The index of the samples to which the data should be subsetted
can be specified with parameter \code{file}. The sole purpose of this function
is to provide backward compatibility with the \code{MSnbase} package. Wherever
possible, the \code{[} function should be used instead for any sample-based
subsetting. Parameters \code{keepChromPeaks}, \code{keepAdjustedRtime} and
\code{keepChromPeaks} can be passed using \code{...}.
Note also that in contrast to \code{[}, \code{filterFile} does not support subsetting
in arbitrary order.
\item \code{filterRt}: filter an \code{XcmsExperiment} keeping only data within the
specified retention time range (parameter \code{rt}). This function will keep
all preprocessing results present within the retention time range: all
identified chromatographic peaks with the retention time of the apex
position within the retention time range \code{rt} are retained along, if
present, with the associated features.
Parameter \code{msLevel.} is currently ignored, i.e. filtering will always
performed on \strong{all} MS levels of the object.
}
}

\section{Functionality related to chromatographic peaks}{

\itemize{
\item \code{chromPeaks}: returns a \code{numeric} matrix with the identified
chromatographic peaks. Each row represents a chromatographic peak
identified in one sample (file). The number of columns depends on the
peak detection algorithm (see \code{\link[=findChromPeaks]{findChromPeaks()}}) but most methods return
the following columns: \code{"mz"} (intensity-weighted mean of the m/z values
of all mass peaks included in the chromatographic peak), \code{"mzmin"} (
smallest m/z value of any mass peak in the chromatographic peak), \code{"mzmax"}
(largest m/z value of any mass peak in the chromatographic peak), \code{"rt"}
(retention time of the peak apex), \code{"rtmin"} (retention time of the first
scan/mass peak of the chromatographic peak), \code{"rtmax"} (retention time of
the last scan/mass peak of the chromatographic peak), \code{"into"} (integrated
intensity of the chromatographic peak), \code{"maxo"} (maximal intensity of any
mass peak of the chromatographic peak), \code{"sample"} (index of the sample
in \code{object} in which the peak was identified). Parameters \code{rt}, \code{mz},
\code{ppm}, \code{msLevel} and \code{type} allow to extract subsets of identified
chromatographic peaks from the \code{object}. See parameter description below
for details.
\item \code{chromPeakData}: returns a \code{DataFrame} with potential additional
\emph{annotations} for the identified chromatographic peaks. Each row in this
\code{DataFrame} corresponds to a row (same index and row name) in the
\code{chromPeaks} matrix. The default \emph{annotations} are \code{"ms_level"} (the MS
level in which the peak was identified) and \code{"is_filled"} (whether the
chromatographic peak was \emph{detected} (by \code{findChromPeaks}) or \emph{filled-in}
(by \code{fillChromPeaks}).
\item \code{chromPeakSpectra}: extract MS spectra for identified chromatographic
peaks. This can be either all (full scan) MS1 spectra with retention
times between the retention time range of a chromatographic peak, all
MS2 spectra (if present) with a retention time within the retention
time range of a (MS1) chromatographic peak and a precursor m/z within
the m/z range of the chromatographic peak or single, selected spectra
depending on their total signal or highest signal. Parameter \code{msLevel}
allows to define from which MS level spectra should be extracted,
parameter \code{method} allows to define if all or selected spectra should
be returned. See \code{\link[=chromPeakSpectra]{chromPeakSpectra()}} for details.
\item \code{dropChromPeaks}: removes (all) chromatographic peak detection results
from \code{object}. This will also remove any correspondence results (i.e.
features) and eventually present adjusted retention times from the object
if the alignment was performed \strong{after} the peak detection.
Alignment results (adjusted retention times) can be retained if parameter
\code{keepAdjustedRtime} is set to \code{TRUE}.
\item \code{dropFilledChromPeaks}: removes chromatographic peaks added by gap filling
with \code{fillChromPeaks}.
\item \code{fillChromPeaks}: perform \emph{gap filling} to integrate signal missing
values in samples in which no chromatographic peak was found. This
depends on correspondence results, hence \code{groupChromPeaks} needs to be
called first. For details and options see \code{\link[=fillChromPeaks]{fillChromPeaks()}}.
\item \code{findChromPeaks}: perform chromatographic peak detection. See
\code{\link[=findChromPeaks]{findChromPeaks()}} for details.
\item \code{hasChromPeaks}: whether the object contains peak detection results.
Parameter \code{msLevel} allows to check whether peak detection results are
available for the specified MS level(s).
\item \code{hasFilledChromPeaks}: whether gap-filling results (i.e., filled-in
chromatographic peaks) are present.
\item \code{manualChromPeaks}: \emph{manually} add chromatographic peaks by defining
their m/z and retention time ranges. See \code{\link[=manualChromPeaks]{manualChromPeaks()}} for
details and examples.
\item \code{refineChromPeaks}: \emph{refines} identified chromatographic peaks in \code{object}.
See \code{\link[=refineChromPeaks]{refineChromPeaks()}} for details.
}
}

\section{Functionality related to alignment}{

\itemize{
\item \code{adjustRtime}: performs retention time adjustment (alignment) of the data.
See \code{\link[=adjustRtime]{adjustRtime()}} for details.
\item \code{applyAdjustedRtime}: replaces the original (raw) retention times with the
adjusted ones. See \code{\link[=applyAdjustedRtime]{applyAdjustedRtime()}} for more information.
\item \code{dropAdjustedRtime}: drops alignment results (adjusted retention time) from
the result object. This also reverts the retention times of identified
chromatographic peaks if present in the result object. Note that any
results from a correspondence analysis (i.e. feature definitions) will be
dropped too (if the correspondence analysis was performed \strong{after} the
alignment). This can be overruled with \code{keepAdjustedRtime = TRUE}.
\item \code{hasAdjustedRtime}: whether alignment was performed on the object (i.e.,
the object contains alignment results).
}
}

\section{Functionality related to correspondence analysis}{

\itemize{
\item \code{dropFeatureDefinitions}: removes any correspondence analysis results from
\code{object} as well as any filled-in chromatographic peaks. By default
(with parameter \code{keepAdjustedRtime = FALSE}) also all alignment results
will be removed if alignment was performed \strong{after} the correspondence
analysis. This can be overruled with \code{keepAdjustedRtime = TRUE}.
\item \code{featureDefinitions}: returns a \code{data.frame} with feature definitions or
an empty \code{data.frame} if no correspondence analysis results are present.
Parameters \code{msLevel}, \code{mz}, \code{ppm} and \code{rt} allow to define subsets of
feature definitions that should be returned with the parameter \code{type}
defining how these parameters should be used to subset the returned
\code{data.frame}. See parameter descriptions for details.
\item \code{groupChromPeaks}: performs the correspondence analysis (i.e., grouping
of chromatographic peaks into LC-MS \emph{features}). See \code{\link[=groupChromPeaks]{groupChromPeaks()}}
for details.
\item \code{hasFeatures}: whether correspondence analysis results are presentin in
\code{object}. The optional parameter \code{msLevel} allows to define the  MS
level(s) for which it should be determined if feature definitions are
available.
}
}

\section{Extracting data and results from an \code{XcmsExperiment}}{


Preprocessing results can be extracted using the following functions:
\itemize{
\item \code{chromPeaks}: extract identified chromatographic peaks. See section on
chromatographic peak detection for details.
\item \code{featureDefinitions}: extract the definition of \emph{features} (chromatographic
peaks grouped across samples). See section on correspondence analysis for
details.
\item \code{featureValues}: extract a \code{matrix} of \emph{values} for features from each
sample (file). Rows are features, columns samples. Which \emph{value} should be
returned can be defined with parameter \code{value}, which can be any column of
the \code{chromPeaks} matrix. By default (\code{value = "into"}) the integrated
chromatographic peak intensities are returned. With parameter \code{msLevel} it
is possible to extract values for features from certain MS levels.
During correspondence analysis, more than one chromatographic peak per
sample can be assigned to the same feature (e.g. if they are very close in
retention time). Parameter \code{method} allows to define the strategy to deal
with such cases: \code{method = "medret"}: report the value from the
chromatographic peak with the apex position closest to the feautre's
median retention time. \code{method = "maxint"}: report the value from the
chromatographic peak with the largest signal (parameter \code{intensity} allows
to define the column in \code{chromPeaks} that should be selected; defaults to
\verb{intensity = "into"). }method = "sum"`: sum the values for all
chromatographic peaks assigned to the feature in the same sample.
}
}

\section{Functionality for backward compatibility}{


These functions for \code{MsExperiment} and \code{XcmsExperiment} ensure compatibility
with the \emph{older} \code{\link[=XCMSnExp]{XCMSnExp()}} xcms result object.
\itemize{
\item \code{fileNames}: returns the original data file names for the spectra data.
Ideally, the \code{dataOrigin} or \code{dataStorage} spectra variables from the
object's \code{spectra} should be used instead.
\item \code{fromFile}: returns the file (sample) index for each spectrum within
\code{object}. Generally, subsetting by sample using the \code{[} is the preferred
way to get spectra from a specific sample.
\item \code{rtime}: extract retention times of the \strong{spectra} from the
\code{MsExperiment} or \code{XcmsExperiment} object. It is thus a shortcut for
\code{rtime(spectra(object))} which would be the preferred way to extract
retention times from an \code{MsExperiment}. The \code{rtime} method for
\code{XcmsExperiment} has an additional parameter \code{adjusted} which allows to
define whether adjusted retention times (if present - \code{adjusted = TRUE})
or \emph{raw} retention times (\code{adjusted = FALSE}) should be returned. By
default adjusted retention times are returned if available.
}
}

\section{Differences compared to the \code{\link[=XCMSnExp]{XCMSnExp()}} object}{

\itemize{
\item Subsetting by \code{[} supports arbitrary ordering.
