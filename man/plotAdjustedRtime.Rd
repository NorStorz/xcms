\arguments{
\item{object}{A [XcmsExperiment()] or [XCMSnExp()] object with the alignment
results.}

\item{col}{color(s) for the individual lines. Has to be of length 1 or equal
to the number of samples.}

\item{lty}{line type for the lines of the individual samples.}

\item{lwd}{line width for the lines of the individual samples.}

\item{type}{plot *type* (see [par()] for options; defaults to `type = "l"`).}

\item{adjustedRtime}{`logical(1)` whether adjusted or raw retention times
should be shown on the x-axis.}

\item{xlab}{the label for the x-axis.}

\item{ylab}{the label for the y-axis.}

\item{peakGroupsCol}{color to be used for the peak groups (only if
alignment was performed using the *peak groups* method.}

\item{peakGroupsPch}{point character (`pch`) to be used for the peak
groups (only if alignment was performed using the *peak groups*
method.}

\item{peakGroupsLty}{line type (`lty`) to be used to connect points for
each peak groups (only if alignment was performed using the
*peak groups* method.}

\item{ylim}{optional `numeric(2)` with the upper and lower limits on
the y-axis.b}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed down to the `plot`
function.}
}
\description{
The `plotAdjustedRtime` function plots the difference between the adjusted
and *raw* retention times on the y-axis against the raw retention times on
the x-axis. Each line represents the results for one sample (file).
If alignment was performed using the *peak groups* method (see
[adjustRtime()] for more infromation) also the peak groups used in the
alignment are visualized.

\examples{

## Load a test data set with detected peaks
data(faahko_sub)
## Update the path to the files for the local system
dirname(faahko_sub) <- system.file("cdf/KO", package = "faahKO")

## Disable parallel processing for this example
register(SerialParam())

## Performing the peak grouping using the "peak density" method.
p <- PeakDensityParam(sampleGroups = c(1, 1, 1))
res <- groupChromPeaks(faahko_sub, param = p)

## Perform the retention time adjustment using peak groups found in both
## files.
fgp <- PeakGroupsParam(minFraction = 1)
res <- adjustRtime(res, param = fgp)

## Visualize the impact of the alignment.
plotAdjustedRtime(res, adjusted = FALSE)
grid()
